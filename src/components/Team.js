Her research aims to understand how microbial communities are impacted by, and in turn, influence processes related to climate change. She is currently studying heterotrophic microbial communities and isolating methanogenic organisms from Amazon peatlands.\n\nIn addition to her scientific pursuits, Lilly is deeply involved in international collaboration through her volunteer work with American Model United Nations.

They received an undergraduate degree in Molecular Biosciences and Biotechnology and are now working on their master’s in microbiology, both at ASU. Biotechnology and microbiology first became fields of interest to Julia when they were taking a biotechnology-focused class at Corona del Sol high school. After that, MBB was a simple choice of major once arriving at ASU.\n\nDuring their undergraduate career, Julia sought out a class with more direct applicability to real research and found a great fit in the MENTOR class taught by Dr. Hinsby Cadillo-Quiroz. The MENTOR class was designed to introduce realistic scientific research to undergraduate students, which was exactly what Julia had been looking for. They particularly enjoyed the class and the experience of becoming involved in actual research. Because of that great experience, they went on to join the Cadillo Lab. Since joining three years ago, they have had a great time learning and growing their research skills.\n\nIn the Cadillo Lab, the work of Julia has been focused on the enrichment, culture, and isolation of methanotrophic bacteria from tropical peatlands in the Amazon. The goal of this research is to better understand the diversity of culturable methanotrophs and potentially discover new species from their sites of interest, as there is a severe lack of cultured tropical methanotrophs. While working on this project, they have developed general research skills, including the ability to formulate research questions and protocols, as well as specific skills such as the use of gas chromatography to monitor the growth of methanotrophs by their consumption of methane.\n\nJulia hopes to finish their master’s program during the Spring 2024 semester and graduate in May. From there, their goal is to find a position in a microbiology lab, potentially in the medical or industrial fields. The synergy of their undergraduate degree and master’s degree would be a great fit and allow them to make a difference.",

Her Master’s research investigates the development of decision-making tools to inform endangered species recovery programs and their funding.\n\nAlice joined the Cadillo Lab in 2023 to explore a deeper understanding of ecosystem functioning at various scales through her interest in microbial ecology and tropical ecosystems, hoping to ultimately tackle bigger questions surrounding climate change. As a first-year PhD student in the Biology & Society PhD program, 4E (Ecology, Economics, and Ethics of the Environment) track, she is currently working on developing her first project in a collaboration between the Cadillo lab and the Conservation Innovation lab. She plans on exploring avenues for ecosystem conservation in the Peruvian Amazon and peatlands by investigating relationships between biodiversity and carbon flux while being conscious of the sociocultural and economic regional landscape. Her additional research interests include interspecies interactions and science teaching at the university level.\n\nAlice’s end goal in research is to collaborate in and develop interdisciplinary methods of tackling climate change and the extinction crisis. As well as conducting research, she would like to eventually have a teaching position at a post-secondary educational institution.",

                Hinsby Cadillo-Quiroz studies how microbes participate in an
                ecosystem and in applied processes. He and his research team are
                investigating whether microbe-mediated organismal and
                environmental interactions drive ecosystem processes,
                particularly carbon cycling. They are also examining how
                ecosystems, in turn, affects the ecology and evolution of
                microorganisms and their interactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dr Cadillo-Quiroz and his collaborators focus on
                methane-producing processes from anaerobic, high carbon-content
                environments, as well as the ecological interactions between
                Archaea, Bacteria, plants and humans. This knowledge can allow
                developing small and large scale solutions for current societal
                or planetary needs. For instance, Dr Cadillo-Quiroz is strongly
                committed to natural and engineered solutions to climate change
                through the power of cooperating with microbes.
